# Bower Power! AngularJS Now PubNub-Enabled

We've been keeping busy lately with a lot of great material
on PubNub and AngularJS integration. One thing that kept
coming up over and over again was getting the Angular SDK
into the Bower registry.

If you haven't heard of Bower yet, it's a super-easy way to
integrate javascript libraries into your web application.
These are some links that we found handy:

* http://bower.io/ : the main Bower splash page
* http://projectpoppycock.com/writing-components-for-bower/ : a *very* nice intro for how to publish to Bower!

We'll keep this short and sweet. Here's how to get the
PubNub AngularJS library using Bower.

1. If you don't already have Bower, install it via ```npm install bower```
1. Grab the latest version from Bower using ```bower install pubnub-angular```
1. Pat yourself on the back for a job well done

Pretty easy, huh?

If you're interested in checking out the code for the
library, it's available here: http://github.com/pubnub/pubnub-angular

Our flagship AngularJS PubNub sample application is
available here: http://pubnub.github.io/angular-js

Hopefully the Bower integration is just one little thing
that makes your application development that much easier.
Thanks for giving the AngularJS library a try, please have
fun, and reach out if you have ideas visit [GitHub pubnub/angular-js](https://github.com/pubnub/angular-js/issues).
